## Space Tourism Website

Created with Html, Sass and JavaScript.

## Project Specifications

This is a website with 4 pages, for planning a trip to space:
    -home page,
    -pick destination page,
    -meet your crew page,
    -space launch page

In this project I used css transitions and js events to add the animations, DOM manipulation to display on the UI, the content which is being fetched from a data.json file and media queries for responsiveness.
This is a frontendmentor.io challange.
